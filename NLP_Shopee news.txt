Quite unusually, both Alibaba and Sea Ltd. published their latest quarterly results this week, after the Chinese giant cut projections and delayed the publication by two weeks earlier in November.

And they do make for a relatively grim reading, after it missed targets for two straight quarters and slashed its forecasts for the entire FY2022.

While much of the company’s problems are down to a slowdown in China and the political crackdown on the country’s digital megacorporations by Beijing, the company has fared equally poorly abroad.

Alibaba hits the ceiling
Its sales on the mainland are still strong, but appear to have hit a limit.

The company posted a YoY increase of 33 per cent for Chinese retail but at 126.8 billion RMB, it is 6.7 per cent down from the quarter ending in June, when its revenues peaked at 135.8 billion RMB.

It’s a similar story abroad, with revenue down to US$1.61 billion from US$1.67 billion in the previous three months — a decline of around 3.6 per cent.

In fact, Alibaba has been at the same level of around US$1.5 to US$1.6 billion per quarter since the beginning of 2021, which indicates it has reached limits to its growth outside China at a time when competitors are making rapid progress.

Meanwhile, Shopee’s parent company, Sea Ltd. has just posted US$1.5 billion in revenue for Q3 2021, up by 134.4 per cent year-on-year and 25 per cent quarter-to-quarter (from around US$1.2 billion in Q2).
